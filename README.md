# Predicting-peptide-bioactivity-with-neural-networks
Peptide bioactivity prediction is the use of machine learning (ML) to predict the biological activity or function of peptides based on their sequence and structural properties.

It involves training models on data derived from experimental studies, where peptides with known activities are characterised, to forecast the activity of novel sequences.
Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), are short, naturally occurring peptides that form part of the innate immune system. AMPs offer promising solutions for drug-resistant pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, fungi, or even cancer cells.

Machine learning models can rapidly screen large peptide libraries, identifying potential candidates for experimental validation. This potentially accelerates drug discovery.
